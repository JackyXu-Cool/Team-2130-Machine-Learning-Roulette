### Project Description: 

Our project is to create a website that allows users to receive an evaluation on the performance of selected machine learning algorithms on the dataset (csv form) which the users upload. In front-end, the website accepts a data set, selects a model or models, and displays statistical model quality results based on other parameter selection. For back-end, we will run the various models, as configured, on the uploaded dataset and offer aggregated quality metrics for the website to render in an informative way.
